    <div class="container-fluid"><div class="ab mb-2">October, 30, 1941 2nd tank army led by General Guderian made 4 attempts to capture Tula city. They succeed to take over Rogojinsky village and received access to southern part of Vsechsvyatskoe cemetery and distillery district. However, they couldn’t get any further. In that critical moment important role in city defence as well as infantry troops, anti-aircraft gunners and the Tula workers' regiment played heavy artillery, 447th cannon artillery regiment in particularity. That regiment was formed in 1939 and received its first trial by fire during Soviet-Finnish war 1939-1940. 152-mm howitzer cannons ML-20 who inflicted fire strikes at the enemy from closed positions were main armament of that regiment. That’s why for according fight tactic few observation posts were made.</div>

    <div class="ab mb-2">Lieutenant Nikolai Rezevtsov was the battery commander of the 447th artillery regiment so he had to find a place for an observation post and that task was brilliantly completed. Nikolai drafted into the Red Army in 1936 by the Borisov-Sudsky district military registration and enlistment office of the Vologda region, he participated in battles with the Finns, in which he proved himself to be a knowledgeable artilleryman and a brave combat commander. He decided to make Obsevation post for his artillery regiment on Vsechsvyatsky cathedral’s bell tower, wich was 82 meters of height. That was perfect post, from here he corrected artillery fire of regiment.</div>

    <div class="ab mb-2">His award documents tell us that during October, 30 thanks to his artillery regiment’s actions the accumulation of German tanks in the area of the village of Novo-Basovo was dispersed and three tanks were destroyed. The next day Rezvetsov's artillery regiment reflected the attack of another enemy tank column, destroyed one tank and scattered the rest. On November 1, thanks to a fire strike of Rezvetsov's howitzers, german infantry troops was dispersed and several enemy machine guns and mortars were destroyed.</div>

    <div class="ab mb-2">On the same day, having transferred fire to the Petelino village area, the artillerymen managed to destroy up to an infantry battalion, a mortar and machine-gun battery of German troops, which contributed to the successful offensive of the Soviet units.</div>

    <div class="ab mb-2">The captain spent about a month at the already famous Vsechsvyatsky cathedral’s bell tower. Attempts by the Nazis to destroy the observation post were unsuccessful. Maybe it was the captain's luck? Or maybe the place where he was destined to repel German attacks was so blessed? For this feat on March 28, 1942, Lieutenant Nikolai Kirillovich Rezvetsov was awarded the Order of the Red Banner. Unfortunately, Nikolai Kirillovich Rezvetsov died on September 22, 1943 in the battles for the liberation of the Smolensk region, commanding a battalion of the same 447th artillery regiment. By this time, he was awarded the Order of the Patriotic War II degree and promoted to the rank of major.</div>

    <div class="ab mb-2">And the four cast angels that were installed in 1863 at the corners of the first tier of the bell tower of the Vsechsvyatsky cathedral still trumpet their copper pipes. The shells and explosions did not destroy them. To this day, we can see these witnesses of the defense of Tula. They remember those terrible days and nights, the roar of cannon fire and how courageously Lieutenant Nikolai Rezvetsov defended the city.</div>
