    <div class="container-fluid"><div class="ab mb-2">Belousov Park is a favorite recreation place for residents and guests of Tula. A lot of entertainment, carousels, cafes, running small children, walks of adults…</div>
    <div align="center"><img src="Parc\img1.jpg" class="img-fluid"></div>

    <div class="ab mb-2">However, not many people remember that the most favorite benches in the shade of young trees on the Central Alley stand next to the trenches that have survived to this day. But there is even a memorial stele there – "These trenches are witnesses of the heroic battle of the Tulyaks against the fascist hordes in the harsh autumn of 1941" - the letters are stamped on it. These lines are knocked out by pain. The pain of those who risked their own lives for our happiness.

    <div class="ab mb-2">We know very little about the fighting in the park. But still some information has been preserved. In the Central Park of Culture and Recreation named after P. P. Belousov in October-November 1941, the front line of defense of the hero city was held. Now it may seem strange that the park was actually the outskirts of Tula, but during the war it was exactly like that. Tanks drove around the Central Park, in particular, near the summer theater, and there was a parachute tower near the fountain-apparently for the initial military training of volunteers.</div>

    <div class="text-center lh mb-2"><small><em>Parachute tower near the fountain. 1941.</em></small></div>
    <div class="ab mb-2">Here, before the invasion of the enemy, according to the decree of the Tula City Defense Committee, women, children, old people, men and young men who did not get to the front dug artillery trenches, in which soldiers of the 39th and 10th batteries of the 732nd anti-aircraft artillery regiment fought. Sometimes you wonder what the residents of the city felt, throwing the earth on the parapet, digging up stones, replacing each other with shovels? Fatigue? Of course, even in those harsh years, people remained just people who knew how to feel, be afraid, get tired. But this is not the main thing. The fact is that they, these war-scorched Tulyaks, were digging trenches in the very park where someone's first date was held, where someone's son still hesitantly got up from the stroller to take his first steps... Here, in this fatal place, joy was replaced by pain. This is what you should think about when you pass through the park, following the traces of the war that have remained forever…</div>

    <div class="ab mb-2">These traces, sometimes, arise not only in our imagination, but also in real life. On the amusement alley, among the noisy children and the enthusiastic cries of adults, a mass grave stands in silence. You will enter a low black fence and it will immediately become quiet. This is how it happens on battlefields – after a battle, you hear only silence. And it is precisely you hear, you feel her presence, as well as the invisible presence of those who rest in a mass grave. Senior political officer Stoyachenko S. I. and fighter Goryachev V. P., participants of the battles for Tula, are buried here. The burial was made on 31.10.1941. On the middle tier of the obelisk there is an inscription: "The military commissar of the 2nd battery 979 a. p. starsh is buried here. political instructor Stoyachenko S. I. and fighter Goryachev V. P., who fell during the defense of Tula on October 31, 1941. " Unfortunately, it has not yet been possible to learn more about the fate of these two ordinary Russian soldiers who defended our city in the distant forty-first. But the archives are declassified, the data is opened, recognized, analyzed… Who knows, maybe they will find some kind of report about them? Whatever it was, we must remember them. Running past the carousels, go to the grave of our defenders, stand and listen to the silence. It will tell you much more than any documents and books.</div>

    <div class="ab mb-2">After the war, the Tulyaks did not forget about the exploits, about the incredible suffering of ordinary guys who fell in the name of life. In 1975-1984, a kind of memorial zone dedicated to the heroic events of the defense of Tula was organized on the Central Alley. On May 9, 1975, in commemoration of the 30th anniversary of the Victory, an obelisk was erected with the inscription: "This obelisk is a witness to the heroic battle of the Tulyaks against the fascist hordes in the harsh autumn of 1941." In the spring of 1978, the Komsomol members of the hero city of Tula planted a 300-meter viburnum alley, and in 1984 two lines of trenches were restored and marked with concrete slabs.</div>

    <div class="text-center lh mb-2"><small><em>Walk of Fame</em></small></div>
    <div class="ab mb-2">Later, other monuments and memorials dedicated to the events of the war were erected. So in the park there was an Alley of Glory, where all the cities of the Tula region are mentioned, an Alley in memory of military signalmen on the circle, a memorial "Immortal Regiment" created from photos of Tulyaks who fought or worked in the rear to bring Victory closer. And yet, when the memories of the war come flooding back, there is no need to grieve and weep. This is not why our ancestors built our fragile world on their own blood, not for sadness, but for happiness. We need to justify their trust, because they have left us the most precious legacy – the Motherland.</div>
