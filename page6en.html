    <div class="container-fluid"><div class="ab mb-2">From the moment the fighter battalions were formed, their combat training was organized according to the program developed by the NKVD administration. On October 23, the fighters of the fighter battalions began to intensively prepare for an early departure to their positions. The militiamen were taught to shoot from rifles, a Maxim machine gun, a Shpagin submachine gun, bayonet combat, throwing grenades and Molotov cocktails. Judging by the photos that have come down to our days, the training of volunteers took place, among other things, within the walls of the Tula Kremlin.</div>

    <div class="ab mb-2">By the beginning of hostilities in the Tula region, the volunteers completed the study of the 120-hour training program. During this period, fighters of the fighter battalions carried out patrol services and guarded industrial and military facilities. As the enemy approached the Tula region, all the destroyer battalions, starting from the western and then the eastern regions of the region, were transferred to the barracks position. On October 26, the Tula Workers' Regiment was formed from separate destroyer battalions. Captain Anatoly Petrovich Gorshkov was appointed its commander, and Grigory Matveyevich Ageev was appointed commissar.</div>

    <div class="ab mb-2">“The entire composition of the regiment by the beginning of the battles for Tula was about 1000 people,” Gorshkov recalled. “There were no regular commanders in the regiment, so fighters of fighter battalions who had already mastered at least the basics of military practice were appointed as unit commanders.” In other memoirs, Anatoly Petrovich expressed himself even more directly: "The contingent of the regiment is somewhat unusual". The commander of the second battalion of the workers' regiment V.N. Yurushkin spoke about this unusualness in more detail in his memoirs. “We came to the Institute of Mechanics. There, Captain Gorshkov, having lined up us, announced that we were a workers' regiment, and that we were ordered to occupy the line of defense on the southern outskirts of the city. And then it turned out that about 20 people from my platoon had never served in the army, they did not know how to use rifles, and some were simply afraid to take them. Here the very approach to the formation of the regiment affected. The staffs gave here everything they didn't need. For example, they gave Leonardov, the son of a priest, to the regiment, Kuznetsov, a morally unstable person who shied away from everything in the air defense bataillon, Seleznev who was a simulator, and so on. And what was strange to us, they gave only two communists, and left the rest under the wing".</div>

    <div class="ab mb-2">But it is worth considering: were the "enemies of the people", simulators and morally unstable people so bad in the ranks of the volunteers? After all, the Tula Workers' Regiment, as best it could, fulfilled its task: the enemy was stopped, Tula did not allow the Nazis to reach Moscow. A person is not known by commission: the best commission is a fight. And this commission was passed successfully. One of the members of the Tula Workers' Regiment was a 17-year-old boy Valentin Akkuratov. This is how Valentin Georgievich told about the events of bygone days: “When the war began, the plant began to be evacuated. I didn't go to the evacuation, but wrote an application to the military registration and enlistment office. Of course, I was not accepted because of my age. And then I joined the Tula Workers' Regiment, where I was enlisted in the 3rd battalion of the 3rd company. More than half of the regiment consisted of young guys, boys of 14 years old ... Of course we knew how to handle weapons: we were shooting in a school shooting range, we were studying in the factory circle "Voroshilovsky shooter", besides, we were physically prepared. But the war was known only by films such as "Chapaev", "Shchors", etc. Rifles at the ready, "Hurray!" and go! But there was no time to really study. On the second day we already received the baptism of fire - on October 30 there was a terrible battle in the Rogozhinsky village. Tanks were marching towards Tula. We had machine guns, grenades and Molotov cocktails in our regiment. That's all the weapons ... "</div>

    <div class="ab mb-2">It is interesting to read the memoirs of a girl who fought in the Tula Workers' Regiment. Alexandra Semyonovna Skripkina (Provotorova) was born on February 5, 1925 in the village. Krutovka Krapivensky (now Shchyokinsky) district. At the time of the beginning of Tula defense she was only 16 years old!</div>

    <div class="ab mb-2">“Due to the war at the end of September 1941, my studies were interrupted, and I left for Tula. I lived in the village of Krasny Perekop, building 10 with my aunt E. A. Provotorova. I took special training courses for air defense instructors. I studied with local residents in the barracks of Krasny Perekop. Relatives helped me to contact the Tula Workers' Regiment. Upon learning that my mother remained in the occupied territory in Krutovka, not far from Shchekino, I was delivered to the 5th school. After the conversation, they helped me get to the house where my mother, Anna Dmitrievna Provotorova (chairman of the collective farm during the war) lived. I collected information about the number and location of enemy troops, especially tank ones. My relatives lived in the villages of Karamyshevo, Zakharovka, Vladychino and Kucheno and i visited them with specials purpose. The information was transmitted through messengers from the Tula workers' regiment which names didn't know. " V.N. Yurushkin told about how the battles took place in the first days of the defense. A copy of his memoirs bears the confirming signature of Gorshkov himself. “So, we went to the 7th school at night. Early in the morning of October 31, we occupied the line of defense in Pionersky Park near the cemetery. And here we missed many men. So from our battery of 380 people only 68 people remained. <…> Where are the others? And only much later, when I was wounded, comrades who returned from the encirclement told me that a few were taken prisoner, there were also few killed, which means that many men simply fled to their homes. <…> At about 5 pm on November 2, I was wounded by shrapnel from a mortar in my face and back, and from that date I dropped out of the working regiment. If our regiment had been organized earlier, then, having trained, the regiment would not have had such losses. And yet, in spite of this, the soldiers of the workers' regiment defended the approaches to Tula with their chest. </div>

    <div class="ab mb-2">The commander of the Tula workers' regiment, Gorshkov, recalls how replenishment arrived before the start of the fighting, and the guys, without even having time to find out their names, were sent to the trenches. They died in their first battle. They asked the platoon commander Zhurilo, under what surnames to bury the soldiers, but he just shrugged his shoulders: “Comrades, they came up with do not know them. No, there were no documents. They found one certificate of “the Voroshilovsky shooter” only". So everyone was buried nameless at the Vsechsvyatsky cemetery. Another unknown soldiers, whose feat is immortal. Such difficult days were for Tula: if you come, get up in line immediately. There was no time for documents, that's for sure ... Of course, now we can talk about "negligence", about irresponsibility and violation of the order of enrollment in the ranks of the Tula Workers’ Regiment ... But do we have the right to do so? Of course no. Because we did not see that horror, that suffering, that grief that our ancestors experienced. We did not take command of the combat area immediately after leaving the encirclement, we did not stop panic and unrest in the city, instead of more detailed preparation for a battle with the enemy. We did not see how schoolchildren, graduates and students, as well as respected professors, poets, musicians, daughters  and girls who did not manage to become brides and mothers - all went under the leadership of Anatoly Petrovich Gorshkov, in order to give their lives in the first battle for the sake of the Victory approach ... We have not seen ... But we know and remember, and must always remember this, preserving what for the sake of which, at the cost of their own lives, our fellow countrymen didn’t gave the enemy an opportunity to breakthrough.</div>
