    <div class="container-fluid"><div class="ab mb-2">	By the decree of the Tula City Defense Committee of 10/23/1941, it was considered necessary to build defensive structures around the city and in the city itself. The leadership of the defense work was entrusted to comrade Melnikov. It was ordered to mobilize the able-bodied population for the construction of defense structures. So, teachers, engineers, students, schoolchildren, workers of factories, shop assistants - all became one organism, all united against the enemy, defended their hometown.</div>

    <div class="ab mb-2">The creation of barricades along the streets of Tula, anti-tank obstacles (ditches etc.) along the outskirts of the city, trenches, dugouts and the adaptation of buildings to fight the enemy began two days later - on October 25, 1941. For this, the entire population of the city was mobilized from 17 to 50 years. In the defense plan of Tula, approved by the commander of 50th army of Red Army, the commanders of the units responsible for the preparation of the defense sectors assigned to them were prescribed on the main streets, namely, the Comintern, Trudovaya, Krasnoarmeyskaya, Krivonogovskaya, Brothers Zhabrovs, Revolutsiy, Kaluzhskaya, Engelsa, Kommunarov ( now Lenin Avenue), Turgenevskaya, Budyonny, Smirnova, Voronezhskaya, etc. to equip barricades by constructing wooden or stone walls with embankment 2 meters high and a ditch depth of 3-3.5 meters. It is hard to imagine that the city center looked like an impregnable fortress, where each person had his place at the barricade or in the window opening.</div>

    <div class="text-center mb-2"><small><em>Barricades on the Kommunarov street</em></small></div>
    <div class="ab mb-2">It was decided to arrange anti-tank bullets at all entrances to the city, near wooden houses and fences on the outskirts of the city and on the streets. In addition, it was ordered to prepare corner stone buildings for street fighting, turning them into fortresses, for which the windows of the lower floors should be bricked on cement with loopholes in which to install heavy machine guns or manual, and in extreme cases machine gunners.</div>

    <div class="text-center lh mb-2"><small><em>Wire fences and barricades in the central part of the street in Tula. The windows of the first floors are covered with masonry</em></small></div>
    <div class="ab mb-2">The documents show that the preparation of the city for street fighting was carried out quite seriously, and the construction of barricades covered many parts of the city, which is confirmed by photographic documents and a schematic plan for the defense of Tula, which shows the location of defensive fortifications (barricades, anti-tank ditches, obstacles, trenches etc.) within the city of Tula.</div>

    <div class="ab mb-2">Combat order for 50th army of Red Army №5 dated 10/30/1941 ordered Colonel Ivanov, the chief of the Tula garrison, to strengthen the preparation of the Tula barrier for barricade battles. This proves once again that our commanders assumed a variety of outcomes for the defense of Tula, up to a battle for every street, for every house, as was the case, for example, in Stalingrad. But the enemy did not go to Tula. Breakthroughs of enemy groups are not excluded, such as, for example, the breakthrough of five German tanks into the Osoaviakhim park (now Rogozhinsky park). But they did not stay there for a long time. People of Tula fought off their city differently – some with a Molotov cocktails, some with grenades, and some with one rifle for three – that the enemy would not pass through our streets, and then would not move to Moscow.</div>
