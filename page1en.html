    <div class="container-fluid"><div class="ab mb-2">In accordance with the Decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR of June 26, 1941, all Tula factories were transferred to 2-shift work with an 11-hour working day, and the leadership of the workshops and departments – to the barracks position. After the German-fascist troops broke through the defense of the armies of the Bryansk Front on September 30 and began to move forward with large forces, Zhavoronkov called the Eagle several times a day like this. For Tula, which was in the deep rear four days ago, suddenly also found itself in immediate danger. However, the famous weapons factory continued to work in the city, cast iron was melted, steel was cooked, cars were made. Large stocks of non-ferrous metals, thousands of tons of grain, cereals, sugar, and oil were stored in warehouses. But from Orel to Tula just a hundred and fifty kilometers!..</div>

    <div class="text-center lh mb-2"><small><em>V. G. Zhavoronkov</em></small></div>
    <div class="ab mb-2">The news that the enemy was in the Eagle stunned and shocked. Internally, however, everyone has been preparing themselves for the worst for a long time. A heavy pause lay between Zhavoronkov's message and the moment when the members of the bureau began to speak. Vasily Gavrilovich listened, weighed every thought expressed and made notes in a notebook. It was necessary to find a solution with which it would be possible to go to factories and factories, to institutions and collective farms, about which it would be possible to report to Moscow. A decision worthy of Tula, its martial traditions, its party organization, its workers.</div>

    <div class="ab mb-2">In the notebook of the chairman of the Tula City Defense Committee it was written:
"1. Tula should become an impregnable fortress on the southern approaches to
Moscow. The enemy's strike on Tula will be a blow to Moscow.
2. All trained reserves should be alerted and sent to General Lelyushenko under the command of military comrades.
3. Throw the entire population to prepare the city for defense-trenches, anti-tank ditches, pillboxes and bunkers.
4. Preparation of premises for new hospitals.
5. Evacuation of factories and stocks.
6. Additional mobilization of party members into the army.
7. Organization of partisan detachments and the party underground.
8. The fight against propaganda, spies and distributors of provocative rumors.
9. Meeting of the party asset".
The Armory capital was in danger, everyone understood that. In order to save machine tools, metal stocks, weapons samples and documentation, and, most importantly, talented and knowledgeable Tula craftsmen, Zhavoronkov decides to evacuate. On October 8, 1941, the evacuation of equipment, workers and engineering and technical workers of factories to the eastern regions of the country began in Tula.</div>
    <div align="center"><img src="TOZ2\img3.jpg" class="img-fluid"></div>
    <div class="text-center lh mb-2"><small><em>Evacuation of defense enterprises</em></small></div>
    <div class="ab mb-2">From time immemorial, the Tulyaks were famous for their ingenuity and resourcefulness. And now the Tula workers had to do the impossible. For example, no more than half an hour was allotted for loading one two-axle car, whereas according to the peacetime norm, two hours were supposed to be spent on this. The weight of some equipment exceeded 10-15 tons-go throw it all into the car in 30 minutes without auxiliary equipment! Conventional machines weighing up to 1 ton were usually moved on " One-two, they took it!". But then they figured out how to speed up the process. They found ordinary sheets of iron with a thickness of 10-12 mm, welded lugs with a cable to them and dragged the machine with the help of cars or manually, taking hold of the ropes. 200-300 m was overcome in this way in 10-15 minutes. Then it took another 3 minutes to raise the machine to the platform. As a result, if according to the norms of peacetime, the evacuation of the enterprise was supposed to take 2-3 months, then in a critical situation it was possible to keep within a month, or even less. The remaining corps, in case the Germans entered Tula, were prepared for an explosion. So, at the end of October, 18 tons of roofing felt, 36 tons of gunpowder, two cars of percussion caps were delivered and laid at the cartridge factory. Bickford cords with detonating fuses were laid to the explosives. If necessary, the plant would have been blown up within five minutes. Not everyone wanted to leave. Many were in a decadent mood in connection with the departure, because their whole life had passed in these factory walls. Some had to be forced by force. On October 23, the evacuation of enterprises continues. At the factory gates and at the train station there are sad scenes of seeing off: parting with loved ones always reacts with pain in the heart, what can we say about wartime, when there is a high probability of "parting forever"... Zhavoronkov traveled around the city every day, carefully monitoring the process of implementing the points of the resolutions of the TGKO. Special attention, of course, was paid to the Tula Arms Factory, because every mistake, every omission with regard to it could undermine the country's defense capability. So, on October 24, it was discovered that the plant manufacturing anti-tank hedgehogs was not able to fulfill the task of the party "not to expose" production. The director left, only the deputy and two workers remained. Of course, the assigned tasks could not be performed by two workers at the right pace. Of course, such mistakes were stopped at the root – the defense of the city is not a game of "war", there should be no omissions here. Despite the fact that a serious threat loomed over the city, defense enterprises continued to work. On November 13, 1941, a number of resolutions were issued regarding the defense industry:
Resolution of the Tula City Defense Committee on the establishment of workshops for the repair of weapons at the Novaya Tula plant":
"1. In order to bring weapons into combat readiness, organize workshops for the repair of weapons at the Novaya Tula plant in Tula.
2. Oblige the director of the Novaya Tula plant Bazhenkov to allocate a group of workers in the number of 10 people to help the military command repair weapons."
Resolution of the Tula City Defense Committee on the manufacture of mortars
"Oblige the director of the weapons factory to organize the production of 82 mm mortars at the factory."</div>
    <div align="center"><img src="TOZ2\img4.png" class="img-fluid"></div>
    <div class="text-center lh mb-2"><small><em>Production of molotov cocktails</em></small></div>
    <div class="ab mb-2">The problem was that most of the raw materials were evacuated. It would seem that how to fulfill the task of the Committee? How to provide weapons to fellow countrymen who repelled attacks on the outskirts of Tula? It is known that the factory workers used auxiliary materials as raw materials. Bottles were used to make homemade grenades – the famous "Molotov cocktail". The Tula people managed to establish the production of a mortar from improvised means. Mortar No. 1 had the corresponding proud name - "Tulyak". Of course, the first samples were immediately handed over to the soldiers of the Tula Workers ' Regiment. It happened on December 1, 1941.</div>

    <div class="text-center lh mb-2"><small><em>Soldiers of the TRP who took the first Tulyak mortar from the Tula Arms Factory</em></small></div>
    <div class="ab mb-2">At the machine factory (now im. Ryabikova) in the shortest possible time, masters under the guidance of S. A. Korovin, S. B. Vartazaryan, etc. we have mastered the production of 82-mm mortars according to the decree. For six months, 2,652 mines were fired from it and 400 enemy soldiers and officers and 36 firing points were destroyed. Probably, many people know the Korovin submachine gun mod. 1941. But, probably, few people know that it was developed at the Tula Arms Factory by the designer S. A. Korovin. Its main feature was its exceptional design and technological simplicity. Almost all the main parts, with the exception of the barrel and the bolt, were stamp-welded structures. So, the bolt box was made of a one-piece pipe, and then the remaining parts of the weapon were attached to it by spot and seam welding. This submachine gun in wartime conditions could be produced at any machine-building enterprise that had press-stamping equipment with a capacity of up to 50-80 tons.</div>

    <div class="ab mb-2">It is interesting that during the days of the siege, the Tula people mastered the production of a mortar based on a captured sample, which was made at several enterprises at once. According to the memoirs of the director of the Novaya Tula plant, M. D. Bazhenkov, the breech of the mortar was made on a lathe of the XIX century with the stamp of the Tula Imperial Peter I Weapons Factory. The machine was then called "Peter I". On November 15, 1941, Zhavoronkov issued a resolution of the Tula City Defense Committee on the repair of small arms: "In order to provide the Red Army units with timely repair of small arms, the Tula City Defense Committee decides: To oblige the director of the arms factory to organize the repair of small arms at the factory, ensuring that repairs are carried out immediately at the request of military units." In forty days assembled and repaired 1764 rifles and 1100 guns.</div>
