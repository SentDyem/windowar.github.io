    <div class="container-fluid"><div class="ab mb-2">June 22, 1941. A solemn meeting was planned on an 20th anniversary of Yasnaya Polyana foundation. But the beginning of the war didn’t let it happen. Short time after, on the 2nd of July it was decided to move the most valuable exhibits to a safer place: objects from Tolstoy's office and from Sofia Andreevna's bedroom, original works of art and books. Work began with the visual fixation of the details of the estate. Architectural sketches and topographical surveys were carried out, trees in the gardens were evaluated and specified.</div>

        <div class="ab">But the museum continued to receive visitors, their number has increased: The Red Army troops were located around, an infirmary was working in the hospital of Yasnaya Polyana, refugees were passing by. "Red Army soldiers from the hospital come here in the amount of 60-70 per day. There is no way we can speak about shutting down the work of the museum, " wrote the writer's granddaughter Sofya Andreyevna Tolstaya-Yesenina. At that point of time she was the director of the United Tolstoy museums.</div>
        <div class="ab">The enemy continued to advance. aerial bombardment of Tula began in August 1941,by October the situation became critical. There was a need for Yasnaya Polyana to become a military camp. Museum workers worried about the fate of the estate buildings because there were dozens of cars and hundreds of soldiers. The museum office was all wired up. But there was no need to worry: sentries were posted to Tolstoy's house and the Kuzminskys ' wing of the house. However, this was not required because the soldiers of the 290th Rifle Division were treating with awe everything that was associated with the name of Tolstoy: "The museum is flooded with visitors from the Red Army. They watch and listen to the guide's story about Tolstoy with exceptional interest. In the afternoon an air-raid alert was issued on Tula, and the rumble of anti-aircraft guns can be heard. The excursions are not interrupted, and the story of "War and Peace", the Patriotic War, the Battle of Borodino, the heroism of the Russian people sounds particularly expressive”. – wrote the museum supervisor Sergei Ivanovich Shchegolev and his wife and researcher Maria Ivanovna in their diaries on October 5, 1941.</div>
        <div class="ab mb-2">On that day, the Tula authorities decided that the museum should be evacuated immediately. On October 9, 2 cars arrived at the railway station closest to the estate (now Kozlova Zaseka) for the cargo transportation and accompanying persons. 110 boxes with things from Tolstoy's house, books and other valuable items and materials went to Tomsk.</div>

        <div class="ab">After 20 days, the Germans came close to Yasnaya Polyana. On the night of October 30, the 290th Rifle Division of the Red Army withdrew to other positions. In the morning, Hitler's soldiers entered the estate, led by General Heinz Guderian.</div>
        <div class="ab mb-2">Nazi placed the hospital in Kuzminskys’ outbuilding and Tolstoy’s house was used by them as barracks, wrote S.I. Shchegolev in his diary. ”In spite of constant assurances that no German soldier will take anything all cabinets and lockers was broke open” he wrote. 99 memorial items was lost completely, 19 was damaged. Tolstoy was a pacifist and the Nazi drenched all the Europe in blood. Cemetery near the writer’s grave became their bad joke on his principles.</div>

        <div class="ab mb-2">Nazi were in Yasnaya Polyana for a month and a half. There was a decree of field marshal Walter von Reichenau that stated:” No historical or artistic values of the East matter”. German soldiers justified their reputation by making bonfires from books.</div>

        <div class="ab">Heads of 50th army of the Red Army made a decision to outflank Yasnaya Polyana with tank units to force German soldiers to retreat. Hostilities in Yasnaya Polyana were interrupted and memorial place was saved for future generations. The first museum tour after nazi retreat was taken by 25 soviet fighters in white camouflages, they visited burnt Tolstoy’s house.</div>
        <div class="ab"> “The squad leader reported that night mission was successfully done and the squad wanted to pay respect to the greatest russian writer by visiting his house and grave” was wrote in quarter report of the museum.</div>

        <div class="ab">And that was a symbolic excursion because war never change but the smell of ashes and blood must be eliminated. Soviet people understood that everything nazi wanted to destroy must be restored to full life. Even win the war at the cost of lost cultural heritage would be a defeat, because without great cultural heritage there won’t be a great future.</div>
        <div class="ab mb-2">In December, 1941, after museum’s liberation there were about 300 visitors, in first quarter of 1942 – about 1200 and every one of them understood that Yasnaya Polyana must be restored. All museum workers were free from their duties and mobilized to Yasnaya Polyana’s restoration that was classified as important state project.</div>
