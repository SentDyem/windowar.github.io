    <div class="container-fluid"><div class="ab mb-2">This place is significant for everyone involved in the life of university. It is situated behind the 2nd academic building. It’s installed on the campus where on June 22, 1941 there was a demonstration, after which the volunteer students and teachers who had a possibility not to go to war became volunteers.</div>

    <div class="ab mb-2">Every day hundreds of students and professors are rushing to classes or returning home are passing by the Stele. There are also citizens of Tula here at the campus. Some of them come to the TulSU sports ground and wellness center, others just walk around. Children often stop at the Stele and read the names of 29 heroes who did not return from the front. Among them are fifteen students: Arkhipov, Golovanov, Egorov, Kirpichev, Krasnyuk, Krylov, Koloskov, Levi, Makarov, Myskin, Pendrik, Petrov, Raev, Chudin, Fateev. And 14 employees and teachers: Amozov, Zasovkin, Kolikov, Kupor, Surkov, Shevtsov, Zakharov, Lavrov, Lapshin, Fedin, Kolikov, Saveliev, Chvirev, Filin. Their names are carved in stone here at the walls of the university from where they went to war and remained forever on its battlefields.</div>

    <div class="ab mb-2">In 1984 new generations of students and teachers began realizing the idea to perpetuate the memory of the fallen “polytechinks” (popular name of the university is “Polytech” due to its history). The organizing committee was created. Hundreds of people worked on “subbotniks” – the clean-up and build-up days for free and made voluntary contributions from scholarships and salaries. They transferred part of the money earned in student construction and agricultural teams. On May 6, 1985, on the eve of the 40th anniversary of Victory in the Great Patriotic War, a Stele “Students and professors who had gone in immortality” was solemnly opened on the campus of Tula State University.</div>

    <div class="ab mb-2">The student design bureau was entrusted with design work. The authors of the memorial S.D. Trefilov and I.L. Kotenev became famous sculptors later. The theme of perpetuating the memory of those who went into immortality was close to both of them: Trefilov's father was a participant in the Great Patriotic War, Kotenev's grandfather was a fighter of the Tula Workers' Regiment.</div>

    <div class="ab mb-2">The side bas-reliefs of the memorial represent a farewell and a return with Victory. The central figure of the composition is a young man in a soldier's overcoat - a second before he becomes a soldier, a day or an hour before he takes the first fight. Valery Inozemtsev, a student of the Faculty of Mechanical Engineering at Tula State University, posed for sculptors.</div>
