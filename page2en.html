    <div class="container-fluid"><div class="ab mb-2">At the end of the 20s of the last century, it was decided to create a higher technical educational institution. This is due to the time of its creation, when technical progress was in full swing in our country, and the fact that at that time there was a developed mechanical engineering and metalworking in Tula. It was planned that the new university would have three faculties: mechanical, chemical and mining. However, the decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Economic Council of the USSR of November 1929 stated that "an institute should be created in Tula, the basis of which will be the Faculty of Mechanical engineering." </div>

    <div class="text-center lh mb-2"><small><em>Students of the Tula Mechanical Institute in the 1930s</em></small></div>
    <div class="ab mb-2">Since October 1, 1930, 240 students have been studying at the institute in four specialties â€“ cold and hot metal processing, tool production, machine tool construction. In 1941, the Tula Mechanical Institute had 25 departments, where 11 associate professors worked, six of whom had a PhD degree. During the 10 pre-war years of its existence, the institute has trained 703 qualified engineers. The industry was developing, the quality of education was improving. Young people received knowledge, gained experience. The country was preparing more and more new personnel. But the war prevented the cloudless plans of Soviet citizens, stopped the fervent dreams of the future. In the first days of the war, most of the employees and students of the TMI went to the front or to the people's militia.</div>

    <div class="ab mb-2">During the defense of Tula, the command post of the 156 NKVD regiment and the Tula Workers ' Regiment was located in the building of the dormitory of the Tula Mechanical Institute, and in fact the command post of the entire southern combat section, parts of which were supposed to defend the city from the south. And here we are very lucky with a historical source. The fact is that Senior Lieutenant Vasily Afanasyevich Benzel, who was the chief of staff of the 956 Rifle regiment of the 299 Rifle Division, writes in great detail about all the vicissitudes of the fighting.</div>

    <div class="ab mb-2">During the days of the defense of the city, V. A. Benzel actually became the chief of staff of the southern section of the defense, commanded by Ivan Yakovlevich Kravchenko. I would like to dwell a little on the biography of this wonderful man. At the beginning of October 1941, near Bryansk, together with his subordinates, Kravchenko was surrounded, but thanks to the ingenuity of the major, the regiment came out of the encirclement without losses. He was summoned to Tula for a trial about the encirclement, but in the end he became one of the organizers of the defense of Tula. Major Kravchenko was appointed commander of the Southern Combat Section. The stories about him are contradictory. Someone considers him a fierce violator of orders, and someone compares him with Alexander Vasilyevich Suvorov, such as the Tula local historian Alexander Lepekhin.</div>
    <div><img src="TulGU\img4.jpg" class="img-fluid"></div>
    <div class="text-center lh mb-2"><small><em>Tula workers ' Regiment. Kravchenko, Anosova, an unknown political worker are sitting. There are the chief of communications of the TRP Vasily Georgievich Petrukhin, the chief of staff of the TRP V. Benzel (top right).</em></small></div>
    <div class="ab mb-2">V. A. Benzel spoke very positively about Major Kravchenko: "Kravchenko's command was so clear that only 17 monsters managed to crawl up to the hill in front of the Brick Factory, as three of them were already engulfed in fire and up to 100 people of submachine gunners turned into silent corpses. The enemy withdrew after a two-hour battle with heavy losses ... < ... > after the attacks of groups of 50 or more tanks with infantry battalions were successfully repelled, these insignificant attempts of the enemy to find a weak spot and break through seemed just a "joke", and were successfully reflected by our defense..." Until now, someone considers Ivan Yakovlevich a traitor, a deserter. But, probably, we should trust the words of Benzel, who, being in the thick of events in the most fateful days of the defense of the city from October 30 to November 1, 1941, saw everything that was happening with his own eyes and described it in his diary without embellishment without embellishment. The uniqueness of the situation also lies in the fact that Benzel kept a diary. And it was forbidden to keep diaries at the front because of the danger of falling into the hands of the enemy. Nevertheless, Benzel recorded the events in it in sufficient detail, so this document is one of the most important historical sources on the history of the defense of Tula. The original is kept in the Central Archive of the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation. According to Benzel, on October 29, 1941, the command post of the combat section was located in the dormitory of the Tula Mechanical Institute, and was located 400-500 meters from the anti-tank ditch, which was supposed to cover the most tank-dangerous direction. In fact, it was the front line of the city's defense.</div>

    <div class="text-center lh mb-2"><small><em>Benzel's diary. "The institute got it..."</em></small></div>
    <div class="ab mb-2">Further in the diary it is noted that the dormitory of the Mechanical Institute became a place of concentration of the command not only of the Tula combat area, but also of individual units. For example, it housed the headquarters of the 1005th rifle regiment. Who played a big role in the defense of the city.  The observation post (NP) of the defensive section was located on the 4th floor of the dormitory. Benzel describes that all day and night on 1.11.1941, the defense sector was shot through by the enemy with intense artillery and mortar fire. "The institute got it. The walls were pierced by shells, not one whole window, the statues in the courtyard of the institute were broken...". Describing the morning of October 31, 1941, Benzel notes the following: "... I watch literally the entire site, it can be seen in the palm of my hand. The defense area is covered with smoke from frequent explosions of shells and mines... the southern wall of the hostel is pecked in the full sense of the word. Not one square meter of undamaged area on the entire wall...". The diary also notes that it was from here, from the building of the dormitory of the Mechanical Institute, Kravchenko gave orders to parry enemy actions, the commanders of individual units gathered here at night to discuss plans for conducting combat operations, and Soviet artillery was located behind the buildings of the Institute.</div>

    <div class="ab mb-2">On November 1, the enemy again repeated the attack with a force of 17 tanks and up to 2 infantry companies from N. Basovo along the Orel-Tula highway in the direction of the Mechanical Institute. In the evening of the same day, the Germans launched a "psychic attack", which was also repelled by the coordinated actions of infantry, artillery and tanks. And what about the institute itself? On October 14, the evacuation to Izhevsk began, where TMI joined the previously evacuated Bauman Moscow State Technical University (then the Moscow Mechanical Engineering Institute). And only in March 1942, the Tula Mechanical Institute partially returned to Tula. Since April 10, classes have resumed, the stability in obtaining higher education, interrupted by the fascists, has begun to improve. TMI started working in full only in 1943.</div>

    <div class="ab mb-2">Students and teachers will forever remember the heroic feat of their fellow countrymen, classmates and colleagues. In memory of the students and employees who died on the fronts of the Great Patriotic War, on May 9, 1985, a Memorial Stele was opened, erected at the expense of students and teachers. On memorable dates, students of the Military Department of Tula State University are holding an honorary Memorial Watch at the Monument to "Students and employees of the Institute Who Went into immortality"</div>
