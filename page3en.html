    <div class="container-fluid"><div class="ab mb-2">After the failure of the Oryol-Bryansk defensive operation, the troops of the Bryansk front, avoiding encirclement and destruction in the cauldron, were able to retreat to new lines under the attacks of the German 2nd Panzer Group (Colonel General G. Guderian) and the 2nd Field Army (Colonel General M von Weichs). According to the historian A.V. Isaev, a characteristic feature of the operation carried out by the commander of the 2nd Panzer Group G. Guderian was "increased attention to a breakthrough into the depths and completely unacceptable neglect of the task of destroying the encircled armies." Soviet troops massively left the encirclement with whole formations in the absence of unblocking strikes, which allowed to restore the front with the expenditure of less forces from the reserve and from other sectors of the front. Thus, the original plan of Operation Typhoon to envelop Moscow from the south was adjusted: the German offensive in this direction was delayed for 17 days, and instead of the rapid defeat of the opposing Soviet troops, the German group received in front of its front heavily thinned but retreating Soviet armies and hastily preparing defensive lines in the area of Tula and the Mozhaisk line of defense. With the help of the population, three defensive lines were created around the city of Tula.</div>

    <div class="ab mb-2">On October 14, the defense headquarters of Tula was created, which issued order №1. Two days later a meeting of the city party activists was held at the Tula Drama Theater (now the Philharmonic). The question was discussed: "The current moment and the tasks of the party organization." The first secretary of the regional committee of the All-Union Communist Party of Bolsheviks V.G. Zhavoronkov made a report. The meeting was attended by over 1000 communists. Everyone vowed to fight to the last drop of blood for the Motherland and, together with the soldiers of the Red Army, to defend Tula from the enemy. From that moment on, the construction of the city's defense by the forces of the 238th division began. The famous photograph of a trench with machine gunners at the intersection of Sovetskaya street and Lenin Avenue refers to this period, there are no barricades yet and everything is just beginning.</div>

    <div class="ab mb-2">On October 22, the City Defense Committee was created (chairman – secretary of the regional party committee V.G. Zhavoronkov, N.I. Chmutov – chairman of the regional executive committee, V.N.Sukhodolsky – head of the regional department of the NKVD and Colonel A.K. Melnikov – commandant of the city).</div>

    <div class="ab mb-2">On October 23, the Tula City Defense Committee issues a resolution "On the construction of fortifications around the city of Tula and in the city". Outrunning the withdrawal of the retreating units and formations of the Soviet 50th army to new defensive lines by the planned date of October 30, on October 24, German troops launched an offensive along the Orel-Tula highway.</div>

    <div class="ab mb-2">On October 25, Tula was declared a state of siege. All forces were mobilized to build field fortifications and barricades. By October 29, a very complex and rather confusing situation with the troops had developed near Tula. The headquarters of the 50th Army did not have a good command of the situation and did not know about the position, combat capability and size of most of the army's divisions. Tula citizens understood that the enemy was at the gate. The Germans, in their intelligence reports and analyzes, predicted that the city was preparing for defense and artillery would be its core, there were no troops in Tula. Indeed, if from the west Tula was covered by troops, apparently they were expecting a strike from this direction, then from the south the defense was organized by people who did not have combat experience. The most organized was the 156th regiment of the NKVD for the protection of railway structures, cargo and tracks – about 1300 people. There was discipline, standard weapons and the ability to use them, but there was no combat experience and artillery.</div>
    <div><img src="Pl\img5.jpg" class="img-fluid"></div>
    <div class="text-center lh mb-2"><small><em>85-mm anti-aircraft gun 52-K of the 6th battery of the 732th anti-aircraft artillery regiment on the defense lines.</em></small></div>
    <div class="ab mb-2">The regiment defended the Orlovskoe highway, Verkhnyaya Kitaevka and Mikhalkovo villages. They were supported by an anti-aircraft battery of the 732 regiment – 4 guns, which included an artillery division of Lieutenant Volneansky – 2 guns and a tank KV with an inoperative engine buried in the ground, apparently the last tank of the 11th  tank brigade or 108th tank division. Moreover, in the Zarechye District there was a second battery of 152-mm guns, which was supposed to support all the troops defending Tula from the west with fire. To the left of the NKVD regiment, the Tula Workers Regiment (TWR), numbering up to 1000 people, occupied the defense, from the Voronezh highway to the river Upa occupied the defense of a group of fighters of 200 people of the 260th division. In the order №5 for the 50th army, a completely different picture was drawn. It clearly describes which troops, which positions they occupy, and the NKVD regiment, TWR and militia take up defense in the second echelon. One trouble is that the troops listed in the order by that time were simply not in Tula, except for the troops of the second echelon, which automatically became the first. Moreover, because of the rains, water rose in the lowland near the Rogozhinsky village from the side of the Gosteyevka village, which is why they could not finish the anti-tank ditch, and the dug area was not protected by czech hedgehogs, mines, or other anti-tank weapons.</div>

    <div class="text-center lh mb-2"><small><em>Lieutenant of the NKVD trains the fighters of the fighter battalion to handle weapons</em></small></div>
    <div class="ab mb-2">The 2nd battalion TWR without anti-tank weapons, not covered by anything, stood in the way of German tanks, which jokingly captured all of Europe and successfully smashed the tank divisions and troops of the Red Army. Whether they could have taken seriously this motley, poorly armed detachment in poorly equipped positions, the ditches that were dug up in their positions does not count. Why ditches? A trench is an engineering structure that has dugouts, firing points, and message trenches - everything, right down to the toilet, not to mention water basins and spillways. There was nothing of this here, and in the conditions of constant autumn cold rains, sometimes with snow, these ditches were half filled with water. So our soldiers had a choice either to freeze in a ditch, or to die from German bullets or under the tracks of tanks. But this situation had little effect on the determination of the soldiers to repulse the enemy. The first machine guns in the TWR were taken from the training ground of the Ammunition Plant, where they fired control lots of new ammunitions from them, and left during the evacuation of the plant.</div>

    <div class="text-center lh mb-2"><small><em>TWR in combat positions</em></small></div>
    <div class="ab mb-2">On October 29, new weapons, SVT rifles and machine guns, were brought to the regiment, and again there was no time or instructors to teach the fighters not only how to use these weapons, but even how to reactivate them and bring them into combat readiness. All night long the TWR fighters studied and mastered the new technique. On the morning of October 28, a group of officers appeared in Tula, led by the Hero of the Soviet Union, Major Kravchenko, he came to the headquarters of the 50th army, where he was sent from the city of Belev to reprisal after the dismissal of the regiment commander, the commander of the 299th division. To the credit of the commander of the 50th army Yermakov, he did not support the division commander, but wrote the following resolution: "Leave in post, transfer from 299 division."</div>
    <div><img src="Pl\img8.png" class="img-fluid"></div>
    <div class="text-center lh mb-2"><small><em>Major Kravchenko I.Y.</em></small></div>
    <div class="ab mb-2">The picture will not be complete, if not to say what the situation was in the city itself. The panic began. Everyone who could tried to leave the city in the direction of Venev. Due to the fact that all forces were thrown into defense robberies began in the city. They robbed apartments, shops, and warehouses. The forces to restore order were not enough, therefore, using the law that gave the city a state of siege, in some cases, especially dangerous robbers were shot on the spot. By evening, the situation in the city was brought under control. Tula concentrated and was preparing for battle. On December 7, the Nazis made an attempt to say the "last word": in the Myasnovo area, the Germans carried out a "psychic attack", but this was already waving their fists after the fight - Tula held out and did not let the enemy pass. Thus, the main goal of Operation Typhoon in October 1941 was not achieved: Moscow was not taken, and the resistance of the Soviet troops was not broken.</div>
